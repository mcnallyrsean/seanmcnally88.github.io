### Reintroducing myself to the world of blogging.

I like writing, I swear. I'm just not very good at doing it consistently. Horrible, in fact. However, I've made a promise to myself to try a bit harder at consistency, so here I am.

I am a graduate of the ACLTC web development bootcamp in Chicago and am currently looking for a full time gig as a full time software developer (junior, of course). There, I got the boring stuff out of the way. I want this to be a fun thing for me to do. Hopefully a post or two will be of some benefit to someone, somewhere. I'll try to keep it simple too, for the fellow beginners and kinda-beginners out there.
